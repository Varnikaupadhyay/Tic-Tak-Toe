# Tic-Tak-Toe
The game is automatically played by the program so no user input is required.
For this NumPy and Random pyhton libraries are used to build this game.Instead of asking the user to put a mark on the board, the code randomly chooses a place on the board and put the mark. It will display the board after each turn unless a player wins. If the game gets drawn, then it returns -1.
